This repository contains a simple Perl script demonstrating common hash operations and error handling. The script showcases how to access, check for the existence of, and modify hash values. It also highlights a potential pitfall: attempting to access a non-existent key without proper checking may result in unexpected behavior. The accompanying solution demonstrates safe key access.
